# Abstract Data Types

Bunch of abstract item types in C++. The following are implemented from the scratch. :heavy_check_mark: stands for completed, :negative_squared_cross_mark: stands for incomplete, and :x: stands for not started :
- Linked List :heavy_check_mark:
- Stack :heavy_check_mark:
- Queue :heavy_check_mark:
- Binary Tree :heavy_check_mark:
- Binary Search Tree :heavy_check_mark:
- Heap
  - array based :heavy_check_mark:
  - pointer based :negative_squared_cross_mark:
- Priority Queue :heavy_check_mark:
- AVL Tree :heavy_check_mark:
- 2-3 Tree :negative_squared_cross_mark:
- 2-3-4 Tree :negative_squared_cross_mark:
- Red-Black Tree :negative_squared_cross_mark:
- Table
  - RB Tree implementation :negative_squared_cross_mark:
  - AVL Tree implementation :heavy_check_mark:
- Hash Table
  - open addressing :x:
  - separate chaining :x:
- Graph
  - adjacency matrix :x:
  - adjacency list :x:

##Important Note
To be able to use this "library", C++17 or above is required. To be able to run the test file, CMake can be used. For that, CMake 3.17 or above is required.
